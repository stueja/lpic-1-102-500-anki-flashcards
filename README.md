# Deck of Anki Flashcards for the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) LPIC-1 Exam 102 only

[LPIC-1 Anki Flashcards](https://github.com/stueja/lpic-1-102-500-anki-flashcards/) contains a deck of flashcards for use with the [Anki](http://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcard system. The deck of flashcards helps to prepare for the [Linux Professional Institute (LPI)](https://www.lpi.org/) [LPIC-1](http://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/lpic-1-overview) (Linux System Administrator) exam, which consists of two exams: 101 and 102. To become LPIC-1 certified, you must pass both, the 101 and 102 exams.
